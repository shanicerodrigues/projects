								<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Los Angeles power plants, asthma and poverty, what do these topics have in relation to each other? Well, through maps we can find correlations between normally disjointed data to reap findings that can, in this case, aid city planning and public health sectors. The magnificent lighting of Los Angeles, whether for attractions, business districts or local housing are all powered by power plants distributed through the city. There are many coal and biomass power plants in the city and are known to be the “dirtier” producers of energy with a lot of smog and particulate matter released from these plants. The city has even made the initiative of marking “Superfund Sites” that are heavily polluted areas requiring cleanup action, and are unsurprisingly near power plant locations. Therefore, it would seem undesirable to have housing near these seemingly toxic establishments, as it would reduce property values. However it is likely that those who cannot pay for more expensive housing further from these power plants would end up living densely around them instead. From these simple conclusions, this map was brought forth to answer the following questions: are power plants found in poorer neighbourhoods and what is the percentage below the poverty line? How much pollution is emitted by these plants and do they correlate with poorer health, such as asthma cases? </p>
								<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to interpret maps like these with a grain of salt, as poor air quality can also be a result of automobile, housing or factory emissions that are not shown on this map. However, it is obvious that the Los Angeles power plants are mostly based in neighbourhoods with at least 11% below the poverty line which is substantial. The pollution emitted by all the plants is high, from 60% [PM2.5] at the minimal to 90% [PM2.5] at the maximum. Surprisingly, the reported asthma cases are low in central west Los Angeles, but is also surrounded by little to zero percentage below poverty line, so healthcare may be more accessible here as more can afford it. From simple power plant locations, we can derive a variety of conclusions of not only their spatial effect on air quality, but how they affect the demographic and health of communities in Los Angeles.</p>
